### Solution

After inspecting the provided code, nothing obvious stands out. After making a few
attempts at various things - xoring the ciphertext against the IV provided a partial
plaintext...weird.

A bit of googling revealed that when encrypting with a weak key, the encryption and 
decryption process is identical. When in OFB mode, the IV is first encrypted against 
the key to provide the first block of keystream, then that block is encrypted with 
the same key to provide the next block of keystream, and so on. Because a weak key
is used, the second (and every even) keystream block is simply the IV. As it turns out
there are also only 4 weak keys in DES - so trying each decryption key and
looking at the result is a fairly simple task.

To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether 'tis Nobler in the mind to suffer
The Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune,
Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep
No more; and by a sleep, to say we end
The Heart-ache, and the thousand Natural shocks
That Flesh is heir to? 'Tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,
To sleep, perchance to Dream; aye, there's the rub,
For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause. There's the respect
That makes Calamity of so long life:
For who would bear the Whips and Scorns of time,
The Oppressor's wrong, the proud man's Contumely,
The pangs of despised Love, the Law’s delay,
The insolence of Office, and the Spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his Quietus make
With a bare Bodkin? Who would Fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscovered Country, from whose bourn
No Traveller returns, Puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have,
Than fly to others that we know not of.
Thus Conscience does make Cowards of us all,
And thus the Native hue of Resolution
Is sicklied o'er, with the pale cast of Thought,
And enterprises of great pitch and moment,
With this regard their Currents turn awry,
And lose the name of Action. Soft you now,
The fair Ophelia? Nymph, in thy Orisons
Be all my sins remembered. BKPCTF{so_its_just_a_short_repeating_otp!}
